# Keeping Up

## Description
This budget tracker can be used either on computer or it can downloaded like an app and it was designed for an everyday user to use it on the go. 
The benefit of using the budget tracker is that even when its offline it will let the user input the information. Then once they have access to 
the internet it will upload that information to the most current state. If the user is on the internet browser it will alert them once it has an internet connection
and it will also alert them that their information has been saved.

## Built With
* express
* mongoose

## Tests
All of these pictures demonstrate how the application will look and the alert boxes that appear on the top. Once the user is ready to move on 
they can click okay and they will be gone.
